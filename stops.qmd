Race and policing are two sensitive topics that continue to raise important questions about fairness and justice in society. Using data from over 400,000 traffic stops in New Orleans collected by the Stanford Open Policing Project between 2011 and 2018, we examine whether Black drivers are arrested at higher rates than White drivers after accounting for sex and officer zone. One potential weakness in our model is that the dataset may not be fully representative of the broader population, as it excludes millions of entries and may disproportionately reflect the behavior of specific officers or zones, potentially biasing the estimated relationship between race and arrest likelihood.

$$
P(Y = 1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_n X_n)}}
$$

$$
Y \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\rho), \quad \text{where } 
\rho = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_n X_n)}}
$$
